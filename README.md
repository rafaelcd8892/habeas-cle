# Habeas CLE

A CLE (Continuing Legal Education) training platform on **immigration habeas corpus**, built for the nonprofit **The Pen & Sword KC** (Sharma-Crawford Attorneys at Law).

It is not a full LMS: it's a **lightweight, authenticated learning platform** that delivers a 4-week virtual program, built on WordPress.

---

## Architecture in one sentence

> The **plugin** (`habeas-cle`) owns all business logic; the **block theme** (`habeas-cle-theme`) handles presentation only; WordPress provides native authentication and roles.

> **Note on the monorepo:** this repo is a *snapshot* of the code. The plugin and theme must live in their `wp-content/` folders to run (WordPress breaks asset URLs if the plugin lives outside `wp-content/plugins/`, which is why we don't use symlinks). Use [`bin/sync.sh`](bin/sync.sh) to move changes between the repo and the live site.

## Features

- **7 Custom Post Types:** Program, Week, Module, Practice Scenario, Template, Schedule Event, Case Update.
- **3 roles:** CLE Student, CLE Instructor, and an extended Administrator.
- **Per-program access control:** content is protected behind login and requires **enrollment** in the specific program.
- **Hierarchy** Program → Week → Module → (Scenario | Template), with Events per week.
- **Progress tracking** (MVP via user meta) with per-week and per-program bars.
- **Model answers** protected server-side (`[hcle_model_answer]`).
- **Student enrollment** managed by instructors.
- **Front door** ("My Training") + breadcrumbs for navigation.
- **Session dates** on Schedule Events.
